###Approach Taken <br>
In this project, I used Canvas technology from HTML5, which it was something new, I had the chance to explore and play with it, I used it to draw the board and all the components (10 pins and the bowling ball). I used JavaScript for the win logic, jQuery for all the events and the DOM and CSS for the styling.

###Unsolved Problems <br>
The first Unsolved problem is to add a loop to draw the pins.
Second Unsolved problem is add spin to the ball.
Third Unsolved problem is to add more players and keep the scores for tournament.
